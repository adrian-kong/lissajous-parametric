# lissajous-parametric
parametric curve sketching lissajous project thing for my school physics project.
<br>
first time using canvas i dont know how to do the sliders for html and stuff so i used input so the code looks very ugly.
<br>
<br>
basically
<br>

<br>
very simple just plotting
<br>
x = acos(mt+c);
<br>
y = bcos(nt+d);
<br>
where a and b are the amplitudes, m and n are the periods, c and d are the phases.
