# lissajous-parametric
parametric curve sketching lissajous project thing for my school physics project.
first time using canvas i dont know how to do the sliders for html and stuff so i used input so the code looks very ugly.

basically
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LissajousCurve.html
very simple just plotting
x = acos(mt+c);
y = bcos(nt+d);
where a and b are the amplitudes, m and n are the periods, c and d are the phases.
